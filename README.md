# Payment Processing Security Implementation

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation for securing payment processing through encryption, tokenization, and error handling. The implementation includes:

- **Ticket 1: Handle Encryption Keys**
  - Secure API connection using HTTPS.
  - Encryption of sensitive payment data with AWS KMS.
  - JWT signing and encryption of payment data.
  
- **Ticket 2: Tokenization and Error Handling**
  - Tokenization of raw card data.
  - Error handling, validation, and logging.
  - Monitoring for security and reliability.

## Ticket 1: Handle Encryption Keys

### Objectives

1. **API Connection**:
   - Implement a secure API connection between the frontend (user input) and backend (payment processing).
   - Ensure data sent over the API is protected by HTTPS to prevent MITM attacks.
  
2. **Data Encryption**:
   - Encrypt sensitive payment information (card details, CVV) before sending to the backend.
   - Use **AWS Key Management Service (KMS)** for encryption.
   - Sign the JWT with a private key from AWS KMS and encrypt the sensitive data within the JWT payload using a public key.

### JWT Fields

- **iss**: Issuer (Identify the payment system).
- **aud**: Audience (Set to the DNS of the Payment Gateway).
- **iat** and **exp**: Define issue and expiration times to limit token validity.

### Implementation Steps

#### Frontend (Credit Card Input UI)

1. Create a form to securely capture credit card details.
2. On form submission:
   - Generate a JWT to securely package the payment details.
   - Sign the JWT with the private key from **AWS KMS** and encrypt the payload using the **public key**.

#### Backend

1. Set up a backend API to:
   - Verify JWT signature.
   - Decrypt the JWT payload.
   - Extract and validate the payment details.
2. Verify JWT fields (`iss`, `aud`, `iat`, `exp`) to ensure token validity.

## Ticket 2: Tokenization and Error Handling

### Objectives

1. **Tokenization**:
   - Use tokenization to replace sensitive card details with a secure token.
   - Prevent backend from storing raw card data.
   - Integrate a tokenization service (using **AWS KMS** or another library) to generate and manage tokens.

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement validation for common input issues (missing fields, incorrect formats, invalid card details).
   - Display clear, user-friendly error messages for invalid inputs.

3. **Logging & Monitoring**:
   - Set up secure logging, ensuring sensitive data is excluded (e.g., no card numbers).
   - Monitor API calls for unusual patterns or failed attempts to detect potential security threats.

### Implementation Steps

#### Frontend (Credit Card Input UI)

1. Capture and validate credit card details.
2. Convert card details into a token (if required by the backend process).
3. Validate input fields (e.g., ensure card number is valid, CVV is numeric).
4. Display meaningful error messages if the user input is invalid.

#### Backend

1. Implement tokenization logic:
   - Receive tokenized payment data, not raw card details.
2. Implement error-handling logic:
   - Catch errors securely, excluding sensitive information from logs.
3. Set up logging and monitoring:
   - Watch for unusual transaction patterns and monitor security.

## Dependencies

- **AWS KMS**: For encryption and key management.
- **Tokenization Library**: To securely replace raw card details with tokens.
- **Backend API**: To handle secure data transfer and tokenization.
- **Frontend (Credit Card Input UI)**: For capturing and validating credit card details.

## Security Considerations

1. **HTTPS** should be enforced for all API communications to protect data in transit.
2. **JWT tokens** should be securely signed and encrypted to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive payment data.
3. Tokenization ensures that raw card details are never directly processed or stored by the backend, reducing security risks.
4. **Error handling and logging** should be implemented carefully, ensuring no sensitive information (such as card numbers or CVV) is logged.

## Testing

1. Conduct end-to-end testing to verify that:
   - Encryption and tokenization processes work as expected.
   - Sensitive data remains secure throughout the transaction process.
   - Error handling, logging, and monitoring are correctly implemented.

## Workflow

### 1. Frontend (Card Data Capturing)
- The user enters their credit card details, such as the card number and CVV, into the UI (e.g., a secure form).

### 2. Encryption During Transmission
- The card data is encrypted during transmission to ensure that it is secure over the network.
- This encryption is typically done using a secure protocol like HTTPS, which ensures confidentiality and prevents data interception during transit.

### 3. Backend (Decryption)
- Once the encrypted card data is received on the backend, it is decrypted.
- The decryption process is handled by a secure service like AWS KMS (Key Management Service) using the decryption key that was used during the encryption phase.
- The backend now has access to the decrypted card details (e.g., card number and CVV).

### 4. Tokenization (After Decryption)
- After the card data is decrypted, it is passed to a tokenization service.
- The tokenization service replaces the sensitive card details (e.g., card number) with a secure, non-sensitive token.
- Example: The card number `4111 1111 1111 1111` could be replaced with a token such as `TOKEN123456789`.
- This token has no direct mapping to the actual card number outside of the tokenization service.

### 5. Use of Token for Transaction
- The backend sends the generated token (not the raw card number) to the payment processor.
- The payment processor uses its own tokenization database to look up the actual card number associated with the token and processes the transaction.
- The token is used for further processing and can be stored for future transactions.

### 6. Token Storage
- The backend stores the token for future use, such as recurring payments, but never stores the raw card details.
- The token can be securely managed and revoked if needed, but the raw credit card information is never stored in the backend system, reducing the risk of a data breach.

## Security Considerations
- **Encryption**: Encryption during transmission ensures that sensitive data is not exposed while being sent over the network.
- **Tokenization**: Tokenization ensures that sensitive card details are never directly stored or processed in the backend system. Only a non-sensitive token is used for transactions.
- **Decryption**: The decryption step only occurs in secure environments and is done using services like AWS KMS to manage and rotate encryption keys.
- **Token Storage**: Storing tokens instead of raw card details reduces security risks in the event of a data breach.

## Dependencies
- **AWS KMS**: For encryption key management.
- **Tokenization Service**: A service or system that handles the tokenization of card data.
- **HTTPS**: For secure communication between the frontend and backend.

## Testing
- End-to-end testing should verify that encryption, decryption, and tokenization processes work as expected.
- Ensure that sensitive data is never exposed or stored inappropriately.
- Test that the tokenization process does not leak sensitive information.

## Conclusion

By implementing these strategies, you ensure that sensitive payment data is handled securely throughout the transaction flow. The encryption of payment details, tokenization, and error handling mechanisms improve security and provide better monitoring and control over payment processing.
