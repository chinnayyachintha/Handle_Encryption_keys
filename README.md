# Payment Processing Security Implementation

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation for securing payment processing through encryption, tokenization, and error handling. The implementation includes:

- **Ticket 1: Handle Encryption Keys**
  - Secure API connection using HTTPS.
  - Encryption of sensitive payment data with AWS KMS.
  - JWT signing and encryption of payment data.
  
- **Ticket 2: Tokenization and Error Handling**
  - Tokenization of raw card data.
  - Error handling, validation, and logging.
  - Monitoring for security and reliability.

## Ticket 1: Handle Encryption Keys

### Objectives

1. **API Connection**:
   - Implement a secure API connection between the frontend (user input) and backend (payment processing).
   - Ensure data sent over the API is protected by HTTPS to prevent MITM attacks.
  
2. **Data Encryption**:
   - Encrypt sensitive payment information (card details, CVV) before sending to the backend.
   - Use **AWS Key Management Service (KMS)** for encryption.
   - Sign the JWT with a private key from AWS KMS and encrypt the sensitive data within the JWT payload using a public key.

### JWT Fields

- **iss**: Issuer (Identify the payment system).
- **aud**: Audience (Set to the DNS of the Payment Gateway).
- **iat** and **exp**: Define issue and expiration times to limit token validity.

### Implementation Steps

#### Frontend (Credit Card Input UI)

1. Create a form to securely capture credit card details.
2. On form submission:
   - Generate a JWT to securely package the payment details.
   - Sign the JWT with the private key from **AWS KMS** and encrypt the payload using the **public key**.

#### Backend

1. Set up a backend API to:
   - Verify JWT signature.
   - Decrypt the JWT payload.
   - Extract and validate the payment details.
2. Verify JWT fields (`iss`, `aud`, `iat`, `exp`) to ensure token validity.

## Ticket 2: Tokenization and Error Handling

### Objectives

1. **Tokenization**:
   - Use tokenization to replace sensitive card details with a secure token.
   - Prevent backend from storing raw card data.
   - Integrate a tokenization service (using **AWS KMS** or another library) to generate and manage tokens.

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement validation for common input issues (missing fields, incorrect formats, invalid card details).
   - Display clear, user-friendly error messages for invalid inputs.

3. **Logging & Monitoring**:
   - Set up secure logging, ensuring sensitive data is excluded (e.g., no card numbers).
   - Monitor API calls for unusual patterns or failed attempts to detect potential security threats.

### Implementation Steps

#### Frontend (Credit Card Input UI)

1. Capture and validate credit card details.
2. Convert card details into a token (if required by the backend process).
3. Validate input fields (e.g., ensure card number is valid, CVV is numeric).
4. Display meaningful error messages if the user input is invalid.

#### Backend

1. Implement tokenization logic:
   - Receive tokenized payment data, not raw card details.
2. Implement error-handling logic:
   - Catch errors securely, excluding sensitive information from logs.
3. Set up logging and monitoring:
   - Watch for unusual transaction patterns and monitor security.

## Dependencies

- **AWS KMS**: For encryption and key management.
- **Tokenization Library**: To securely replace raw card details with tokens.
- **Backend API**: To handle secure data transfer and tokenization.
- **Frontend (Credit Card Input UI)**: For capturing and validating credit card details.

## Security Considerations

1. **HTTPS** should be enforced for all API communications to protect data in transit.
2. **JWT tokens** should be securely signed and encrypted to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive payment data.
3. Tokenization ensures that raw card details are never directly processed or stored by the backend, reducing security risks.
4. **Error handling and logging** should be implemented carefully, ensuring no sensitive information (such as card numbers or CVV) is logged.

## Testing

1. Conduct end-to-end testing to verify that:
   - Encryption and tokenization processes work as expected.
   - Sensitive data remains secure throughout the transaction process.
   - Error handling, logging, and monitoring are correctly implemented.

---

## Conclusion

By implementing these strategies, you ensure that sensitive payment data is handled securely throughout the transaction flow. The encryption of payment details, tokenization, and error handling mechanisms improve security and provide better monitoring and control over payment processing.
